# Train-Simulation
This project is all about modelling with features of OpenGL .The starting point is a small virtual space that consists of a plain surface and a simple parallel railway track running on it. It also consists of a clear sky. The train consists of an engine attached to two bogies and electric wire are attached to the train for power supply. Engine as well as the bogies contains wheels rotating as well as translating in forward direction.
For each of the component present in the virtual space, a function has been written which consists of code to draw the components . Each object is defined using the coordinate system that makes modelling convenient. Sky, plain surface, railway track, engine and bogies are drawn by using GL_QUADS primitive one or more number of times. Some more elements are added to the engine to make it look closer to a real world engine by using a user-defined function which contains the code to draw the components, for example of a circle to obtain the wheels of the train. Wheels are drawn using a user-defined function which contains code for drawing a circle. Parallel slant lines are drawn on the railway track using GL_LINES primitive to draw a single line and loops are used to create a set of parallel slant lines to make it look like a track.
Once the static object is drawn, the next step is giving linear motion to the train over a straight track. Through this simulation of the train can be obtained.
